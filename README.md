aws provide you with servers and services that you can use on demand and scale easily; aws cloud history: 2002 internally launched, 2003 Amazon infra is one of their core strength ideal to market, 2004 launched publicly with SQS, 2006 re-launched publicly with SQS,S3,EC2; aws cloud number facts: 2019 aws had $35.02 billion in annual avenue, 2019 aws accounts for 47% of the market(Microsoft is second with 22%), pioneer and leader with over 1,000,000 active users; aws cloud use cases: aws enables you to build sophisticated scalable applications, applicable to a diverse set of industries, use cases including: enterprise IT, backup&storage, big data analytics, website hosting, mobile&social apps, gaming; aws global infra: aws regions, aws availability zones, aws data centers, aws edge locations/pts of presence, click to view: https://infrastructure.aws/, (1)aws regions: aws has regions all around the world, a region is a cluster of data centers, most aws services are region-scoped, how to choose an aws region? compliance with data governance and legal requirements -data never leaves a region without your explicit permission, proximity to users -reduced latency, available services within a region -new services and new features are not available in every region, pricing -varies region2region and is transparent in the service pricing page; (2)aws AZs: each region has many AZs(usually 3 min2 max6), such as aws region Sydney ap-southeast-2 has ap-southeast-2a,ap-southeast-2b,ap-southeast-2c, each AZ is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, connectivity, AZs are separate from each other so that they are isolated from disasters, AZs are connected with high bdwidth ultra-low latency networking; (3)aws PoPs/edge locations: Amazon has 216 PoPs(205 edge locations and 11 regions caches) in 84 cities across 42 countries, content is delivered to end users with lower latency; (4)aws has global services including: identity and access mgmt(IAM), dns service Route 53, content delivery network CloudFront, web application firewall(WAF), most aws services are region-scoped including: Amazon EC2 -IaaS, Elastic Beanstalk -PaaS, Lambda -FaaS, Rekognition -SaaS. <br /><br />
IAM :Users&Groups: root account created by default should not be used or shared, users are people within your org and can be grouped, groups only contain users not other groups, users do not have to belong to a group and user can belong to multiple groups; IAM :Permissions: users or groups can be assigned json documents called policies, these policies define permissions of users, in aws you can apply the least-privilege-principle -do not give more permissions than a user needs; IAM :structure:
```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Id": "S3-Account-Permissions",
  "Statement": [

        "s3:Putobject"
      ],

    }

IAM :password policy: in aws you can setup a password policy that set a min password length, require specific char type like uppercase letters lowercase letters numbers non-alphanumeric chars, allow all IAM users to change their own passwords, require users to change their password after some time(password expiration), prevent password re-use, IAM :multifactor authentication(MFA): users have access to your account and can possibly change configs or delete resources in your aws account, you want to protect your root accounts and IAM users, MFA=password you know + security device you own, main benefit of MFA that if a password is stolen/hacked the account is not compromised; how can users access aws? 3 options including: aws mgmt console protected by password plus MFA, aws command line interface(CLI) protected by access keys, aws sw development kit(SDK) for code protected by access keys, here access keys are generated through aws console and users manage their own access keys, access keys are seceret just like password do not share them; what is aws CLI? a tool that enables you to interact with aws servers using commands in your command-line shell, direct access to public APIs of aws services, you can develop scripts to manage your resources, it is open-source: https://github.com/aws/aws-cli/, alternative to using aws mgmt console; what is aws SDK? lang-specific APIs(set of libs), enables you to access and manage aws services programmatically, embedded within your application, such as aws CLI is built on aws sdk4Python(others including: JS,PHP,.NET,Ruby,Java,Go,Node.js,C++); IAM :roles for services: some aws service will need to perform actions on your behalf, to do so we will assign permissions to aws services with IAM roles, common roles including: EC2 instance roles, Lambda func roles, CloudFormation roles; IAM: security tools: IAM credentials report(account-level) that lists all your account's users and status of their various credentials, IAM access advisor(user-level) that shows service permission granted to a user and when those services were last accessed you can use this info to revise your policies. <br /><br />
